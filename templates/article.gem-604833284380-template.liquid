It’s a good time to rest and recuperate before things get busy!</p><p><br></p><p>You might want to combine it with a baby shower and enjoy a fun-filled get away with the girls, or you may want to keep it to you and your partner to enjoy some downtime before parenting kicks in.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Where can I go on vacation when pregnant?</strong></p><p>Depending on how far you are through pregnancy, you can either travel abroad or, if you want to avoid long journeys, there are plenty of great locations within the UK or your own country.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>When should I book my babymoon?</strong></p><p>In reality, you can book your babymoon whenever suits you. In terms of safe travelling, a good time to aim to travel would be between weeks 16 and 24, as this is when you will have a bit more energy and before general pregnancy discomfort kicks in.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Should I fly when pregnant?</strong></p><p>This depends on how far you are through pregnancy. It is recommended that you do not fly after 36 weeks of pregnancy. Not only does it present risks, but the chances are also that you will be more uncomfortable and tired, so long-haul traveling is not ideal. Likewise, if you’re in the early weeks of pregnancy, morning sickness and general discomfort might make travelling too much of an exertion, so maybe avoid the first 12 weeks.</p><p><br></p><p>Either way, if you’re unsure whether it’s safe for you to fly while pregnant, it’s best to consult your GP. The NHS offer lots of great advice on travelling when pregnant.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Are babymoon’s safe?</strong></p><p>Of course! A babymoon is like any normal holiday, only you’re smuggling an extra person along for the ride. As long as you follow the guidelines around travelling while pregnant and consult your GP if you have any other conditions, you should be fine.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Where should I go on my babymoon?</strong></p><p>This is your holiday, so pick somewhere you’d be happy and relaxed. If you enjoy foreign holidays in the sun, do that. If you prefer to stay a little more local, then there are plenty of great places to stay right here in the UK.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>What should I do on my babymoon?</strong></p><p>A babymoon is a great time to catch up on rest before baby arrives, so be sure to avoid any holiday activities that are too strenuous. You might love white water rafting or climbing Everest, but this is not that sort of break. This is a time to let your body (and mind) relax - forget about pushchair shopping and birthing plans and enjoy a well earned break. So book things that will put you at ease.</p><p><br></p><p>Just be sure to check that any activities you book are safe during pregnancy. Some spa treatments, hot tubs and other activities are best to avoid. Consult with your GP if you’re not sure.</p><p><br></p></div></div></div></div><!--gfsplit--><div data-label="Row" data-key="row" data-atomgroup="row" id="r-1679414368174" class="gf_row" data-icon="gpicon-row" data-id="1679414368174"><div class="gf_column gf_col-lg-12 gf_col-md-12 gf_col-sm-12 gf_col-xs-12" id="c-1679414368102" data-id="1679414368102"><div data-label="Heading" data-key="heading" data-atomgroup="element" id="e-1679414372425" class="element-wrap" data-icon="gpicon-heading" data-ver="2" data-id="1679414372425"><div class="elm text-edit gf-elm-center gf-elm-left-lg gf-elm-left-md gf-elm-left-sm gf-elm-left-xs" data-gemlang="en" data-exc=""><h2 class="gf_gs-text-heading-2">Babymoon Destinations | Top 5 UK Destinations from Spa Breaks</h2></div></div><div data-label="Text Block" data-key="text-block" data-atomgroup="element" id="e-1679414386447" class="element-wrap" data-icon="gpicon-textblock" data-ver="1" data-id="1679414386447"><div class="elm text-edit gf-elm-left gf_gs-text-paragraph-1" data-gemlang="en"><p>From award-winning restaurants to beautiful gardens, luxurious afternoon teas to pregnancy massages, here are some of the most beautiful spa destinations for an upcoming babymoon or even a baby shower!
